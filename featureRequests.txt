DONE Get some sounds working. Follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNtuLw2fybo

    ALSO watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXWvfrmpapI

    DONE Compress font to desired glyphs.

DONE Make a moving line with the Rect tool

DONE Synchronise the movement of the line with the sheet music and the sound output

DONE Create a random sequence of notes with generating logic.
    DONE Sound and Line animation are synchronised
    DONE Note placement should be synchronised to make line animation linear.

DONE Make the notes fit into bars

... Clean up the conditionals determining the note bars and note tails.

DONE Clean the bpm

NO Wrap the drawing, the sound and the animation with one function so that variables can be distributed amongst all of them.
    - Can't see the utility in this right now, just seems like I'd be createing deeper layers of scoping for no reason.

DONE Want the drawing to wrap itself properly

0.5 and 0.25 should join with each other when adjacent according to pulse

DONE - many improvements to come, like responsiveness to differing measure widths... A line should be drawn between the measures

DONE I want to be able to call a stop to the play back and animation with the click of a button.
    Still need to call stop.
    Should only be able to click play once whilst in play through

Figure out how to scroll the canvas without changing the canvas size

Make the graphics scalable

Perhaps there should be a minimum bar size, or 0.25 spacing distance.
